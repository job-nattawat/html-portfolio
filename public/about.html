<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I recently graduated in the exciting field of insurance and statistics from Chulalongkorn University, where I fell in love with the power of data. My journey through the maze of numbers and patterns not only sharpened my analytical skills but also ignited a passion for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.</p>

<p>I've had the opportunity to intern as a Business Intelligence Developer at Agoda and as a Data Scientist at FWD Life Insurance. These experiences taught me the real magic behind data. From improving database quality through innovative methodologies to implementing machine learning techniques for data completion, Iâ€™ve learned the importance of data in strategic decision-making firsthand.</p>

<p>I've dipped my toes in almost every programming language like R, Python, SAS, and SQL that can help me make sense of data. And I didn't stop there! Embracing continuous learning, I've bagged certifications in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analytics, and more, seeking to widen my horizon every single day.</p>

<p>If you're passionate about data or looking for a collaborator to explore new data-driven opportunities, I'd love to chat. Together, we can turn numbers into impactful stories that drive success. Drop me a message or connect with me right here on LinkedIn!</p>
